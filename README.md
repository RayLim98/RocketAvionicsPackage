### This is everything I worked on on the code of the rocket ###

*note that this isn't the full code and only contains what I've work on

A rocket has multiple states. The states of a rocket can only realistically change in a certain order.
  Armed -> Launching -> Ascending -> Apogee -> Descending -> Landed
The point of this code is to make sure that the rocket transfers between each state safely, and process realtime 
data for observation.
